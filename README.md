# Linear_Regression_Using_Numpy
A simple implementation of linear regression from scratch using Numpy. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training with gradient descent, and performance evaluation using mean squared error (MSE) without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn.

# Linear Regression from Scratch using NumPy

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch using only **NumPy** — without relying on any machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. It serves as a foundational exercise in understanding how the algorithm works under the hood.
