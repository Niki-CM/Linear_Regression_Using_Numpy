# Linear_Regression_Using_Numpy
A simple implementation of linear regression from scratch using Numpy. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training with gradient descent, and performance evaluation using mean squared error (MSE) without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn.
